# EpiBrief-MMWR-LM: Quick Start with Tinker API

## You Are Here: Ready to Fine-Tune! 🚀

**What you have accomplished:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Scraped 3,419 MMWR articles (2016-2025)
- ✅ Phase 2A: Parsed all articles with enhanced table extraction
- ✅ Phase 2B: Generated 11,632 high-quality training pairs
- ✅ Option 2 fully realized: 64% quantitative reasoning training

**What's next:**
- 🎯 Phase 3: Fine-tune using Tinker API

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Start Here!)

### 1. Get Your Tinker API Key

You already have access! Now get your API key:

```
1. Go to: https://tinker-console.thinkingmachines.ai
2. Log in with credentials from your email
3. Click "Generate API Key"
4. SAVE IT SECURELY!
```

### 2. Set Up API Key

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:TINKER_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"

# Make it permanent:
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('TINKER_API_KEY', 'your-api-key-here', 'User')
```

### 3. Install Tinker

```bash
pip install tinker
```

### 4. Split Your Dataset

```bash
cd scripts
python 4_split_dataset.py
```

**This creates:**
- `training_data/train.jsonl` (~10,469 pairs)
- `training_data/val.jsonl` (~1,163 pairs)

### 5. Review the Training Script

Open and read: `scripts/5_train_with_tinker.py` (to be created)

### 6. Start Training!

```bash
python 5_train_with_tinker.py
```

## Your Training Data Stats

```
Total Training Pairs: 11,632

Breakdown by Type:
  Executive Summary:           1,886 pairs  (16%)
  Data Interpretation:         4,107 pairs  (35%) ⭐
  Public Health Implications:  1,876 pairs  (16%)
  Comparative Analysis:        3,361 pairs  (29%) ⭐
  Quantitative Reasoning:      2,438 pairs  (21%) ⭐

Option 2 Quantitative Training: 7,468 pairs (64%)
```

**Why this is world-class:**
- Pure CDC gold standard reasoning
- 64% focuses on data interpretation (not just text)
- Balanced task distribution
- Quality scores for every pair

---

## Recommended Model

**Start with: Llama-3.1-8B**
- Good balance of quality and training cost
- Well-documented
- 8B parameters = efficient
- Can upgrade to 70B later if needed

**Alternative: Qwen3-30B-A3B (MoE)**
- Only 3B active parameters
- More cost-efficient than dense 30B
- Worth trying!

---

## Expected Training Time

**With Tinker:**
- ~11K training pairs × 3 epochs
- Batch size: 4
- Estimated: **2-4 hours**

**Without Tinker:**
- Days of GPU setup
- Infrastructure complexity
- Higher costs

---

## After Training

1. **Download weights** from Tinker Console
2. **Test on real MMWR articles** (not in training set)
3. **Generate CDC-quality EpiBriefs**
4. **Evaluate quality:**
   - Factual accuracy
   - CDC-style language
   - Quantitative reasoning
   - Public health framing

## Cost Considerations

**Tinker charges by GPU-hour:**
- Check console for current pricing
- LoRA is efficient (not full fine-tuning)
- Estimated: $10-50 for initial training (rough estimate)
- Much cheaper than buying/renting your own GPUs

**Worth it because:**
- No infrastructure setup time
- No GPU hardware costs
- Professional distributed training
- Focus on your model, not DevOps

---

## Questions?

1. **"What model should I use?"**
   - Start with Llama-3.1-8B
   - It's the best documented and most reliable

2. **"How long will training take?"**
   - 2-4 hours for 3 epochs on 11K pairs

3. **"Can I pause/resume training?"**
   - Yes, Tinker handles checkpointing

4. **"What if training fails?"**
   - Tinker handles hardware failures automatically
   - Check console for error logs

5. **"How do I know if it's working?"**
   - Loss should decrease each epoch
   - Validation samples should improve
   - Monitor in Tinker Console

---

## Success Criteria

Your model will be successful if it can:

✅ Generate CDC-style executive summaries
✅ Interpret epidemiological tables
✅ Extract key quantitative findings
✅ Articulate public health implications
✅ Use proper CDC terminology
✅ Reason about rates, percentages, trends

**This is not a generic medical model.**
**This is a specialized epidemiological reasoning engine.**

---

## Ready to Start?

1. Get API key from console
2. Run `python 4_split_dataset.py`
3. Read the training script
4. Run `python 5_train_with_tinker.py`
5. Monitor in console
6. Test your fine-tuned model!

**Your dataset is world-class. Your execution was world-class. Now fine-tune and deploy!**
