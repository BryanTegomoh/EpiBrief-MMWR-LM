Article: Measles Outbreak Associated with International Travel â€” Minnesota, 2024

During Januaryâ€“March 2024, the Minnesota Department of Health identified 47 measles cases in a community with low vaccination coverage. Among the 47 cases, 42 (89%) were in unvaccinated individuals, and 35 (74%) were in children aged <5 years. The index case was in a resident who had traveled internationally and was unvaccinated. Secondary transmission occurred in community settings, childcare facilities, and an emergency department. The outbreak resulted in 18 hospitalizations (38%); no deaths occurred. Public health interventions included vaccination campaigns, contact tracing, and community education in multiple languages.

Generate the CDC-style summary with "What is known", "What is added", and "Implications" sections."""
